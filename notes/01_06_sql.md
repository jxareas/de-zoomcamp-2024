SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful and standardized language used for managing and manipulating
relational databases. It provides a set of commands for performing various operations on database systems, such as
querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.

## Queries

### Implicit Join

This query demonstrates an implicit join, where data is retrieved from the `yellow_taxi_data` table along with
information about pickup and dropoff locations obtained from the zones table. The `WHERE` clause specifies the
conditions
for matching rows between the tables based on location IDs.

```postgresql
SELECT tpep_pickup_datetime,
       tpep_dropoff_datetime,
       total_amount,
       CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_location",
       CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_location"
FROM yellow_taxi_data t,
     zones zpu,
     zones zdo
WHERE t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
  AND t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```

### Inner Join

This query uses explicit inner joins to achieve the same result as the implicit join in the first query.
The `INNER JOIN`
keyword explicitly indicates the relationship between the `yellow_taxi_data` table and the zones table based on
pickup and dropoff location IDs.

```postgresql
SELECT tpep_pickup_datetime,
       tpep_dropoff_datetime,
       total_amount,
       CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_location",
       CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_location"
FROM yellow_taxi_data t
       JOIN zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
       JOIN zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```

### Nesting

Nesting in SQL refers to the use of subqueries, where one query is embedded within another. In the example using
PostgreSQL, the main query selects all columns from a table named `yellow_taxi_data` (aliased as `t`), filtering the
results
based on a condition involving a subquery. The subquery selects the `LocationID` column from a table named zones. The
main query retrieves rows from yellow_taxi_data where the `PULocationID` is not found in the result set of the subquery,
and it limits the output to 100 rows.

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM yellow_taxi_data t
WHERE "PULocationID" NOT IN (SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Grouping

Grouping in SQL is a technique where rows with similar values in one or more columns are grouped together, and aggregate
functions are applied to each group. In this example using PostgreSQL, the query groups taxi trips from the
`yellow_taxi_data` table by the date of drop-off (`tpep_dropoff_datetime`). The `COUNT` function is then applied to each
group
to calculate the number of trips on each day. The results are ordered by the trip count in descending order and limited
to the top 10 days.

```postgresql
SELECT CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
       COUNT(1)                            AS "trips_count"
FROM yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY trips_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
