`dbt` is a transformation workflow that allows anyone that knows SQL to deploy
analytics code following good software engineering practices such as modularity,
portability, CI/CD and documentation.

## How does it work?

Each model is a sql select statement (no DDL or DML) which will compile and run
in our data warehouse. Whenever we do a `dbt run` all that code is compiled and run against our
data warehouse, to be finally persisted back to it.

## How to use dbt?

There are two options to run dbt, either with `dbt` Core or `dbt` Cloud. The differences between both of them
are shown in the table below:
