# Workshop I: Data Ingestion with `dlt`

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll learn how to build data ingestion pipelines like a senior data engineer: Quickly,
concisely,
scalable, and self-maintaining. For this purpose, we'll use **`dlt`**, a python library created for the purpose of assisting
data engineers to build simpler, faster and more robust pipelines with minimal effort.

We’ll cover the following steps:
* Extracting data from APIs, or files.
* Normalizing and loading data
* Incremental loading
